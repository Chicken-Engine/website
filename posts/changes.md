Hello everyone, happy new year!

Recently I've made some rather important changes I think that need to be addressed.

# So.. what's going on?

A bit ago I decided I wanted to rewrite the entire engine from the ground up, right from the beginning.
I made this decision because I felt like the code wasn't all the best, and it could be really annoying for me to rewrite all that code I previously did. There were even some
unfinished and janky code as well, which just wasn't a good look at all, so that's my first decision.

Secondly, I might scrap or change some assets we already have, like the logo. I'm going to get that changed to make it feel a bit more unique instead of your average FNF engine logo. That's currently my only asset change I've decided on at the moment, there probably will be more in the future.

Anything that gets scrapped can be released by the person that created it if they want to, don't try and ask the creator of the asset to give it to you, they didn't publish it for a reason.

Lastly, I'm encouraging dev applications, we need anyone that can just generally help with the engine, assets, coding, music, you name it, you can probably help.

Last year we didn't really interact with the community, we didn't post blogs, we didn't do much, but this year we want to keep this thing going no matter what, even if
We have to cut corners here and there to get to some sort of release.

This year I am wanting to dedicate my full focus towards this engine and interact more with the community.

You might wonder, "Is there a deadline for the engine?" And the answer is no. The reason is that I don't really work well with deadlines at all, and I believe you'll get something we want to publish without a deadline instead of an engine that we published because we had to.

That's all I really wanted to say for this blog, If you have any questions ping me in the community server.
See you in the next blog
