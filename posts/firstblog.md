Hello Everyone!
in this blog I'll be sharing some information on the current progress on the engine itself and I might get some of the other devs to write some things here as well, so that should be fun!

#L Website Release

Yesterday I was working on this site for HOURS on end lol, I was exhausted when I finally finished everything I needed done, I started at like 12 AM to 7 AM GMT+1.

I wanted to get this website done as soon as possible since I felt like we needed to go from that weird looking page to this brand new better looking one.

My plan for this website is to hopefully share more information on what's going on development wise and whatnot. This website is honestly something I'd like to add stuff to over time so it's not the same mostly all the time. I would attempt to make a system for the blog stuff but at the moment I'm just going to keep it the way it is (which is manually adding these.)

The progress of the engine is going smoothly, everything is going as It's mainly supposed to aside from the few changes that need to or could be changed. I currently have 3 people working on this engine at the moment of writing this blog those people are

This is the best team I've ever had, It does take time to build a team but I think at the moment 4 team members are enough for us at the moment.
I can probably show off a small teaser of something we've been planning.

That's right, we are making a launcher for the engine! The launcher will contain a few features to either make stuff quicker so you dont have to open the engine to do it or just having to update the engine in general!

This is going to be pretty good, especially for some people lol.

I think thats the end of todays blog! wish you guys a fantastic time!
(gonna do something the funkin.me blog does since I've been listening to this song on loop lmao)

#L Todays blog song is..
