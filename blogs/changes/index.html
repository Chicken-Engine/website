    <h1>Big Changes</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 11, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>Written By:</strong> Sofy</p>   <p>Hello everyone, happy new year!</p>
<p>Recently I&#x27;ve made some rather important changes I think that need to be addressed.</p>
<h1>So.. what&#x27;s going on?</h1>
<p>A bit ago I decided I wanted to rewrite the entire engine from the ground up, right from the beginning.</p>
<p>I made this decision because I felt like the code wasn&#x27;t all the best, and it could be really annoying for me to rewrite all that code I previously did. There were even some</p>
<p>unfinished and janky code as well, which just wasn&#x27;t a good look at all, so that&#x27;s my first decision.</p>
<p>Secondly, I might scrap or change some assets we already have, like the logo. I&#x27;m going to get that changed to make it feel a bit more unique instead of your average FNF engine logo. That&#x27;s currently my only asset change I&#x27;ve decided on at the moment, there probably will be more in the future.</p>
<p>Anything that gets scrapped can be released by the person that created it if they want to, don&#x27;t try and ask the creator of the asset to give it to you, they didn&#x27;t publish it for a reason.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m encouraging dev applications, we need anyone that can just generally help with the engine, assets, coding, music, you name it, you can probably help.</p>
<p>Last year we didn&#x27;t really interact with the community, we didn&#x27;t post blogs, we didn&#x27;t do much, but this year we want to keep this thing going no matter what, even if</p>
<p>We have to cut corners here and there to get to some sort of release.</p>
<p>This year I am wanting to dedicate my full focus towards this engine and interact more with the community.</p>
<p>You might wonder, &quot;Is there a deadline for the engine?&quot; And the answer is no. The reason is that I don&#x27;t really work well with deadlines at all, and I believe you&#x27;ll get something we want to publish without a deadline instead of an engine that we published because we had to.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all I really wanted to say for this blog, If you have any questions ping me in the community server.</p>
<p>See you in the next blog</p>
