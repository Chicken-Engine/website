    <h1>First Engine Blog!</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> August 10, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Written By:</strong> Sofy</p>   <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>in this blog I&#x27;ll be sharing some information on the current progress on the engine itself and I might get some of the other devs to write some things here as well, so that should be fun!</p>
<e1 id="Website Release"></e1>
<p>Yesterday I was working on this site for HOURS on end lol, I was exhausted when I finally finished everything I needed done, I started at like 12 AM to 7 AM GMT+1.</p>
<p>I wanted to get this website done as soon as possible since I felt like we needed to go from that weird looking page to this brand new better looking one.</p>
<p>My plan for this website is to hopefully share more information on what&#x27;s going on development wise and whatnot. This website is honestly something I&#x27;d like to add stuff to over time so it&#x27;s not the same mostly all the time. I would attempt to make a system for the blog stuff but at the moment I&#x27;m just going to keep it the way it is (which is manually adding these.)</p>
<p>The progress of the engine is going smoothly, everything is going as It&#x27;s mainly supposed to aside from the few changes that need to or could be changed. I currently have 3 people working on this engine at the moment of writing this blog those people are</p>

<p>This is the best team I&#x27;ve ever had, It does take time to build a team but I think at the moment 4 team members are enough for us at the moment.</p>
<p>I can probably show off a small teaser of something we&#x27;ve been planning.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s right, we are making a launcher for the engine! The launcher will contain a few features to either make stuff quicker so you dont have to open the engine to do it or just having to update the engine in general!</p>
<p>This is going to be pretty good, especially for some people lol.</p>
<p>I think thats the end of todays blog! wish you guys a fantastic time!</p>
<p>(gonna do something the funkin.me blog does since I&#x27;ve been listening to this song on loop lmao)</p>
